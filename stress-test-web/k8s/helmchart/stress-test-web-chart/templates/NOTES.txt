Thank you for installing stress-test-web-chart!

To access the stress-test-web application, follow these steps:

1. **Check the Deployment:**
   - Ensure that the Deployment is running by using the following command:
     ```bash
     kubectl get deployments -n YOUR_NAMESPACE
     ```
   - Verify that the desired number of replicas are ready.

2. **Check the Pods:**
   - Verify that the Pods are running successfully:
     ```bash
     kubectl get pods -n YOUR_NAMESPACE
     ```

3. **Check the Service:**
   - Ensure that the Service is accessible:
     ```bash
     kubectl get services -n YOUR_NAMESPACE
     ```
   - Note the external IP or hostname under the "EXTERNAL-IP" column. If using a LoadBalancer, it may take some time to obtain an external IP.

4. **Access the Application:**
   - Once the external IP or hostname is available, you can access the stress-test-web application using the following URL:
     ```
     http://EXTERNAL-IP:8090
     ```
   - If a specific nodePort is used, replace `EXTERNAL-IP` with the node's IP and the appropriate port.

5. **Additional Configuration:**
   - If you have customized configuration options, such as environment variables, ConfigMap, or Secrets, ensure that they are correctly applied to the Deployment.

For any issues or further assistance, please refer to the documentation or contact your system administrator.
